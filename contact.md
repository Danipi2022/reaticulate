## Bugs and Features

The best way to report bugs or request features is through
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jtackaberry/reaticulate/issues).

It does require a (free) GitHub account, but having a ticket open helps me track the issue better.

## Forums

Reaticulate has active threads on several popular forums.  Below are direct links to the Reaticulate

## Email

Open dialogue on one of the above forums is encouraged, but if you prefer email, you can reach me [here](mailto:tack@urandom.ca).


## Donations

I am always humbled by those who wish to kick a few bucks my way.  I would be grateful and even more motivated if you would instead donate to a secular humanitarian charity and [let me know about it](mailto:tack@urandom.ca?subject=I+made+a+donation+because+of+Reaticulate).  I recommend [Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders)](https://www.msf.org/donate).

Your money can be put to much better use than I'm able, and knowing that my work has improved the life of someone in need, even if indirectly and in a small way, is something I find truly inspiring.
