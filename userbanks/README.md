# User Submitted Reaticulate Banks

These banks are provided by other Reaticulate users.  They are **uncurated** and **untested** and quality will vary.  At the very least, they can serve as starting points for your own customizations.

If you find problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jtackaberry/reaticulate/issues).

And if you have a bank to contribute to this list, please also [open an issue](https://github.com/jtackaberry/reaticulate/issues) or pass it along via [email or one of the forums](https://reaticulate.com/contact.html).

## Installation

1. Find a library you wish to import and click the link
2. Copy the contents of the file to your clipboard
   * You may find this easier if, after opening the file, you click the Raw button on the top right in the GitHub file view.  Then you can press ctrl-A to Select All and ctrl-C to copy to clipboard.
3. In Reaper, click the pencil icon in the Reaticulate's toolbar and select `Import Banks from Clipboard`
   * This will append the imported banks to the end of your `Reaticulate.reabank` file.  Don't worry, all of your existing banks will remain intact.
